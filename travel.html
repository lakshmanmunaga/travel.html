<p class="mountain">Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism,<br>
 which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years. Once mountain building ceases<br>
 mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering<br>
 through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, and through erosion by rivers and glaciers.
